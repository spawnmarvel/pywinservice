# pywinservice, running a simple Python script as a windows service

# v 1.1
## Getting Started
Make an env
<br>
Make a script i.e like run.py
<br>
Test this:
<br>
Make a bat file, that will be started when the service starts (i.e 3 party libraries will start) activate the env: ~\pywinservice\Scripts\activate.bat
```
~\pywinservice\Scripts\activate.bat
```
<br>
Call the Python script file, ie run.py python app\run.py runserver

```
python app\run.py runserver
```
<br>
If test is success, install the service with Nssm:
<br>
<br>
* [Nssm](https://nssm.cc/download) - NSSM - the Non-Sucking Service Manager
<br>
<br>
nssm install, navigate to your bat file, give the service a name

```
nssm install
```
<br>
Start the service with the name you made
<br>
<br>
### Note:
This is just a quick and dirty way to run Python scripts as a windows service, but heey, it works and you can automate a lot of scripts!
